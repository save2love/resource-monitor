# Resource Monitor for PC

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/save2love/resource-monitor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/save2love/resource-monitor)

![Device view](/img/device.jpg "Device")

Simple and useful project, made to monitor system resources without opening Task Manager. It can show you CPU and RAM usage, HDD and network activity. All data are visualize with charts. On host system uses Python script for collecting resources utilization that makes monitor is crossplatform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Software

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software "Arduino IDE")
* [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python 3.5")

#### Arduino libraries
* [LiquidCrystal I2C by Marco Schwartz](https://github.com/marcoschwartz/LiquidCrystal_I2C "LiquidCrystal I2C")
* [Bounce 2 by Thomas O Fredericks](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2 "Bounce 2")

#### Python libraries
* [PSUtil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/ "PSUtil")
```
pip install psutil
```
* [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/ "pyserial")
```
pip install pyserial
```

#### Hardware

### Configuring

All you need is change COM port on corresponding port number in [config.py](/agent/config.py "config.py")
To test communication you need start [agent_console.py](/agent/agent_console.py "agent_console.py"). Console will show you actually transferred data in table view.

### Autostart

You can setup to auto start python script in Windows using Task Scheduler and in Linux using cron

#### Windows

Here is [ResourceMonitorTask.xml](agent/ResourceMonitorTask.xml "ResourceMonitorTask.xml") for importing to Task Scheduler. All you need is change the path for agent.pyw script in Action tab.

#### Linux

You can use *cron* for autostart agent-script every minute but it was not tested by me.

### Screens

  - Default screen (full information about CPU, RAM, Network and HDD)
